envvars take priority over variables set in the config/conf.json file in case both are set (the registry user & pass values can also be set by using the standard "~/.docker/config.json" file and not setting them as envvars and the Nebula config file ), it's suggested to always wrap envvars values in quotation marks but it's only required if the envvar uses special characters (for example "mongodb://mongo_user:mongo_pass@mongo_host:27017/?ssl=true&replicaSet=mongo_replica_set&authSource=mongo_auth_schema"), some variables have defaults that will be used if they are not set as envvars and in the conf.json file.

An example config file is located at "example_conf.json" at the /config/ folder of the manager github repo (and inside the containers of them by extension).

The following table shows the path of each config file inside the docker containers:

| container      | config path inside container | example Dockerfile COPY command overwrite       |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| manager        | /www/config/conf.json        | COPY config/conf.json /www/config/conf.json     |

As the manager uses gunicorn as the main application web-server inside the container there is a config.py at the container root folder which is pulled from the repo /config/config.py file, consult [gunicron guide](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/index.html) if you wish to change it's parameters.
